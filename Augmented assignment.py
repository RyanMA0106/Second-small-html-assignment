# number = '9,223,372,036,854,775,807'
# cleanedNumber = ''
#
# for i in range(0, len(number)):
#     if number[i] in '0123456789':
#         cleanedNumber += number[i]
#
# # cleanedNumber = cleanedNumber + number[i] is replaced with the above. this is augmented assignment.
# # this is better as their is less work for the pc to do. ie doesnt have to evaluate variable 2 times.
# # augmented assignment can also be used with subtraction multiplication or division ie -= *= /=
# # can also use powers ie x **= 2 or remainder x %= 2 will show the remainder after 2 going into x
#
# # this can also be used in these other examples
#
# greeting = 'good'
# greeting += ' morning '
# print(greeting)
#
# greeting *= 5
# print(greeting)
